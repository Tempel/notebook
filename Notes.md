Prototype 1
===========

Made 2014-01-07 (and the next several days to finish assembly)

Observations
------------

* Rivet holes in wood fit the short rivet posts well, but were too tight for
  the large rivet posts and rivet caps.  Holes in leather had no problem
  fitting.
* Rivet heads flattened out and spread on the anvil side (not the hammer side).
  This made them marginally overlap the edges of the wood.
* Longer rivets have larger heads (~9 mm diameter).  This would have been a
  problem for the double-layered areas, but I found that the smaller caps
  worked reasonably well with the larger rivets.
* Snap works well, but has some between-material thickness that I hadn't
  accounted for in the lengths.fcstd file.
* Notepad sits a little looser than I'd like.  Looks like there's ~1.5 mm
  around all sides (3 mm on two sides when pushed into the corner).
* Pen fits well in holder.  Slightly larger might make it easier to return the
  pen while the book is in my pocket.  Peter doesn't care for the design, so
  the future may have a different approach.
* Pen sits low in holder.  There's plenty of material above, so I should move
  it up a bit.
* A full pad of sticky notes is 9.5 mm thick, thinner than the 10.16 on which
  I had based the design
* Leather is loose even with a full pad (i.e. too much material in the hinge
  and closing flap).  Looser on the hinge side than flap side, due to the
  unaccounted-for snap thickness.
* Book is a little larger than is comfortable for some of my pockets; it can be
  difficult to get in or out.

Changes
-------

* Increase rivet hole diameter from 3 mm to 3.5 mm.
* Increase rivet head landing by 1 mm.
* Use thinner wood; Peter has some at thinkhaus that's ~3/32" thick.
* Shrink notepad space by 2 mm.
* Reduce leather hinge length by 15 mm.
* Reduce leather closing flap length by 9 mm.
* Increase pen holder cut length by 1 mm.
* Raise pen holder position by 10 mm.
